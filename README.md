# 'Vertical Rhythm' a theme for Habari 0.7

A text only theme as used on http://edvanbeinum.com. This is certainly not ready to be dropped into another site but it it here as it may be useful as the basis for your own theme.
It doesn't have comments or search or multiple entry templates since it was intended to be a super simple theme.

 * The markup is based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) and also implements so-called 'responsive web design' which essentially means it resizes to accomodate smaller screens.
 * Tested on FF4, Chrome and Safari on OSX and breifly in IE7 & 8, Chrome and Opera on Windows.
 * Also uses the font 'Arvo' from the [Google Web fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Arvo)
 * Uses [Prettify](http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/) for syntax highlighting
 * Uses the [978 Grid System](http://978.gs/)
 * Colour scheme based on [Conspicuous Creep](http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/663167/Conspicuous_Creep) by [Dammar](http://www.colourlovers.com/lover/dammar)
 * The .htaccess is a combination of the H5BP htaccess and the Habari rewrite rules. Move it to the Habari root directory if you want to use it - test it first though!
 * Works best if you have the [Habari Twitter Plugin](http://trac.habariproject.org/habari-extras/browser/plugins/twitter/trunk/) installed
 * I am grateful to [Jon Rohan's](http://jonrohan.me/guide/css/creating-triangles-in-css/) blog entry on Creating Triangles in CSS and also to [Jonathan Snook](http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/css-text-rotation) for his post on Text rotation in CSS.
